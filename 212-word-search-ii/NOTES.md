TIME COMPLEXITY EXPLANATION
For single word search in a 2d matrix in WORD SEARCH 1 problem we apply dfs at every point of matrix for that we run 2 for loops and their time complexity is m×n and in each dfs we visit 4^(sizeofword) because we are applying dfs calls to 4 directions for each character of the given word , so the time complexity for that will be m×n×4^(sizeofword).Now coming to this problem, if we dont use Trie we will use the code of word search 1 problem but we will run 1 more for loop for each word in words array , so the time complexity of that would be no_of_word×(m×n×4^(sum_of_lengths_of_all_words)) .Here, we are using trie because of that we dont need to run the extra for loop for each word due to which time complexity drops to m×n×4^(length_of_largest_word) where length_of_largest_word is the height of the trie.
